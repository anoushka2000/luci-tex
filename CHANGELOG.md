## [Unreleased]

### Added
- diff: New `luci diff` subcommand to generate LaTeX diffs between a git ref
  and either the working tree or another ref. Produces `<stem>_old.tex`,
  `<stem>_new.tex`, and `<stem>_diff.tex` in `<stem>-diff/` by default, with
  optional custom output directory and compilation.

### Changed
- cli: Improve help text formatting and descriptions for all commands.

### Fixed
- archive: Resolve `.cls` vs `.bst` ambiguity and include nested local dependencies.
- archive: Correctly handle `\input` commands wrapped inline by another commands
- check: Flag undefined acronyms from the `acronym` package
- check: Detect biblatex-style split-line undefined citation warnings.

### Tests
- archive: Add coverage for `\documentclass` resolution.
- check: Added tests for undefined citations, references or missing files.
- diff: Add tests covering OLD vs working tree, two-ref mode, and custom
  output directory; latexdiff is monkeypatched to avoid external dependency.
